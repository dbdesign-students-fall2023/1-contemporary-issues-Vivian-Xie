##Passage 1: [A Nonprofit Wants Your DNA Data to Solve Crimes](https://www.wired.com/story/genetic-genealogy-nonprofit-dna-database/)  
This passage discusses the use of genetic genealogy database in solving crimes, particularly the case of Joseph James DeAngelo, known as the Golden State Killer. It explains how investigators created a DNA profile of DeAngelo using public genealogy databases to identify his genetic connections and build a family tree to apprehend him. 

The cases in the passage shows the great power of DNA databases in tracking down criminals. However, there are a lot of public concerns about the potential risks of uploading people's personal DNA data, including the possibility of being linked to a criminal investigation. The author believes that as long as the genetic genealogy is regulated by law enforcement, the evolving landscape of DNA crime-solving is bright enough.


##Passage 2: [Police Are Getting DNA Data From People Who Think They Opted Out](https://theintercept.com/2023/08/18/gedmatch-dna-police-forensic-genetic-genealogy/)  
In contrast to the previous passage, the author argues that the exploit of DNA databases has raised ethical concerns, primarily due to the invasion of privacy and the potential for misuse.The passage highlights a loophole in the GEDmatch database, which allows genetic genealogists to access DNA profiles of individuals who have explicitly opted out of sharing their genetic information with law enforcement. This loophole was exploited by some genealogists working with police. 

The reason why the writer is strongly against the criminal information collection in databases is that people uploading their DNA can't consent for their relatives and family, but the DNA they uploaded representing themselves also include the other people's privacy content. The writer calls for further legal restrain on the improper application of DNA databases.
